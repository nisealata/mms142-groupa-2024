Discussing more about the foundational background of this rapidly rising, Singapore-based e-commerce platform, Shopee launched in 2015 to 7 distinct countries across Southeast Asia (Shopee, n.d.). This initial coverage spanned Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines; but has since reached East Asian countries such as, China, South Korea, and Japan; as well as far more international locations such as, Brazil, and Mexico (Shopee, n.d.).

In terms of organizational structuring, Shopee Pte Ltd is a subsidiary company to parent company Sea Limited. With the leadership of past CEO, Chris Feng; and current CEO, Forrest Li, both having a bumpy history with the company (Dean, 2024). Back in 2015, the leadership of Feng resulted in a positive outlook for the company; with over 4 million installations of the app, as well as 3 million items listed by December of 2015 (Dean, 2024). Despite these early signs of success, Shopee would remain unprofitable until its Q4 in 2022 (Cordon, 2023). As throughout 2015 to mid-2022, Shopee would encounter numerous setbacks such as, (a) being incapable of reaching revenue growth targets, (b) failing to expand to foreign markets, and (c) mishandling the layoffs of over 7000 employees (Ng, 2023). But, as a result of Shopee's impressive turnaround in 2022, Shopee would become the leading e-commerce platform by total traffic share, in Southeast Asia, as of 2024 (TMO Group, 2024). 

As the main topic to discuss in this report, e-commerce growth did not occur entirely in a vacuum. Numerous shifts between the existing retail market, and the newer—yet maturing, e-commerce market, have transformed consumer trade. To uncover this trend in how Shopee has become a disruptive technology to physical retail, this report will examine how both markets compare with each other, and how the foreign and domestic retail industry has become affected by e-commerce.

### *The Consumer Experience with Physical Retail Shopping*

There are struggles when dealing with being a consumer in physical retail stores. Since online shopping is competitive, convenience must be prioritized. With wider options to buy from, low prices, and other delivery options, physical retailing could be hard to compete with online retail stores. On the downside of inventory management problems, physical stores have more limitations than online stores. Overstocking and understocking are handled wisely in physical stores more than when dealing with online retail sellers (Rodgers, 2024).

Given in physical retail stores, rent when available, utilities and staff salaries are ones to be considered at first. If these aspects were taken for granted, the system of physical retailing may fail the minor ones to be considered and decided. The profitability of the goods being sold should be considered as well to maintain the balance in sales. Other than that, the decline in using digital platforms hinders the whole growth of running a physical retail business. If there are tools used for facilities that must be upgraded, guidelines must be followed in the procedure if possible. Moreover, consumers’ preferences are monitored to tailor the needs of a physical retail store (Rodgers, 2024).
