Discussing more about the foundational background of this rapidly rising, Singapore-based e-commerce platform, Shopee launched in 2015 to 7 distinct countries across Southeast Asia (Shopee, n.d.). This initial coverage spanned Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines; but has since reached East Asian countries such as, China, South Korea, and Japan; as well as far more international locations such as, Brazil, and Mexico (Shopee, n.d.).

In terms of organizational structuring, Shopee Pte Ltd is a subsidiary company to parent company Sea Limited. With the leadership of past CEO, Chris Feng; and current CEO, Forrest Li, having a bumpy history with the company (Dean, 2024). Back in 2015, the leadership of Feng resulted in a positive outlook for the company; with over 4 million installations of the app, as well as 3 million items listed by December of 2015 (Dean, 2024). Despite these early signs of success, Shopee would remain unprofitable until its Q4 in 2022 (Cordon, 2023). As throughout 2015 to mid-2022, Shopee would encounter numerous setbacks such as, (a) being incapable of reaching revenue growth targets, (b) failing to expand to foreign markets, and (c) mishandling the layoffs of over 7000 employees (Ng, 2023). But, as a result of Shopee's impressive turn around in 2022, Shopee would become the leading e-commerce platform by total traffic share, in Southeast Asia, as of 2024 (TMO Group, 2024). 

As the main topic to discuss in this report, e-commerce growth did not occur entirely in a vacuum. Numerous shifts between the existing retail market, and the newerâ€”yet maturing, e-commerce market, have transformed consumer trade. To uncover this trend in how Shopee has become a disruptive technology to physical retail, this report will examine how both markets compare with each other, and how the foreign and domestic retail industry has become affected by e-commerce.
