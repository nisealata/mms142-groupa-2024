# Shopee as a Disruptive Technology to Traditional Walk-in Establishments/Malls

## Introduction

The shopping landscape has completely changed over the last few years, gone are the times when people will look for something in-store as a first attempt. E-commerce has reshaped how consumers shop, with platforms like Shopee leading the charge in Southeast Asia. As a digital marketplace, Shopee enables users to browse and purchase products seamlessly through their devices, revolutionizing accessibility and convenience. In contrast, traditional retail stores rely heavily on physical presence and customer foot traffic, which limits their reach and flexibility.

The global retail landscape has seen significant shifts with the emergence of platforms like Shopee. E-commerce sales in the Philippines alone have reached remarkable highs in recent years, accounting for a significant share of the economy (Statista, 2024). Shopee's success can be attributed to its user-friendly app, integrated payment solutions, and gamified shopping experiences, distinguishing it from brick-and-mortar establishments (Business Insider, 2020; Google et al., 2024).

While traditional retailers rely on physical spaces to provide a sensory shopping experience, Shopee offers unparalleled convenience, cost-effectiveness, and scalability (Digimid, n.d.). This dynamic juxtaposition of physical and online retail underscores Shopee's transformative impact in redefining how consumers interact with markets.

By bridging the gap between digital convenience and retail essentials, Shopee has not only introduced a new paradigm for shopping but has also catalyzed shifts in consumer behavior that challenge the relevance of traditional walk-in establishments (Business Insider, 2020).

Discussing more about the foundational background of this rapidly rising, Singapore-based e-commerce platform, Shopee launched in 2015 to 7 distinct countries across Southeast Asia (Shopee, n.d.). This initial coverage spanned Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines; but has since reached East Asian countries such as, China, South Korea, and Japan; as well as far more international locations such as, Brazil, and Mexico (Shopee, n.d.).

In terms of organizational structuring, Shopee Pte Ltd is a subsidiary company to parent company Sea Limited. With the leadership of past CEO, Chris Feng; and current CEO, Forrest Li, both having a bumpy history with the company (Dean, 2024). Back in 2015, the leadership of Feng resulted in a positive outlook for the company; with over 4 million installations of the app, as well as 3 million items listed by December of 2015 (Dean, 2024). Despite these early signs of success, Shopee would remain unprofitable until its Q4 in 2022 (Cordon, 2023). As throughout 2015 to mid-2022, Shopee would encounter numerous setbacks such as, (a) being incapable of reaching revenue growth targets, (b) failing to expand to foreign markets, and (c) mishandling the layoffs of over 7000 employees (Ng, 2023). But, as a result of Shopee's impressive turnaround in 2022, Shopee would become the leading e-commerce platform by total traffic share, in Southeast Asia, as of 2024 (TMO Group, 2024). 

As the main topic to discuss in this report, e-commerce growth did not occur entirely in a vacuum. Numerous shifts between the existing retail market, and the newer—yet maturing, e-commerce market, have transformed consumer trade. To uncover this trend in how Shopee has become a disruptive technology to physical retail, this report will examine how both markets compare with each other, and how the foreign and domestic retail industry has become affected by e-commerce. 

## Market Differentiation: The Consumer Experience with Shopee, versus, with Physical Retail

### *The Consumer Experience with Physical Retail Shopping*

There are struggles when dealing with being a consumer in physical retail stores. Since online shopping is competitive, convenience must be prioritized. With wider options to buy from, low prices, and other delivery options, physical retailing could be hard to compete with online retail stores. On the downside of inventory management problems, physical stores have more limitations than online stores. Overstocking and understocking are handled wisely in physical stores more than when dealing with online retail sellers (Rodgers, 2024).

Given in physical retail stores, rent when available, utilities and staff salaries are ones to be considered at first. If these aspects were taken for granted, the system of physical retailing may fail the minor ones to be considered and decided. The profitability of the goods being sold should be considered as well to maintain the balance in sales. Other than that, the decline in using digital platforms hinders the whole growth of running a physical retail business. If there are tools used for facilities that must be upgraded, guidelines must be followed in the procedure if possible. Moreover, consumers’ preferences are monitored to tailor the needs of a physical retail store (Rodgers, 2024).

## Existing Market Disruption

**The State of Physical Retail**

The global state of physical retail is marked by dynamic change - its sphere constantly being shaped and affected by several factors including the economic state and consumer behavior. One of the biggest manifestations of this dynamism is the apparent decline of physical stores in the previous decade, captured in the phenomenon described as a “retail apocalypse” (Chun et al., 2023). Several reports detail the extent of this transformation. In the United States, Peterson (2019) reported a staggering number of 9,300 stores closing, while Hartmans (2021) estimates a number of 80,000 retail stores and 25% of malls to close by 2026. Major, iconic retailers like Toys “R” Us, Forever 21, and Sears have all filed bankruptcies within the previous decade (Here’s a List of 154 Bankruptcies in the Retail Apocalypse – and Why They Failed, 2023). Abandoned, dilapidated closed-down stores have been garnering attention, putting into perspective the demise of these once bustling spaces (Lakritz, 2020).

The underlying reason for the retail apocalypse is manifold, but certainly isn’t a mystery. One of the biggest factors that this phenomenon is attributed to is the unparalleled growth of e-commerce in the previous decades, anchored to the growing capabilities of information technology ushered by the digital age (Chun et al., 2023). Additional reasons contributing to physical retail’s decline are the extent of debt of chain retailers, and internal management missteps (Sandler & Kim, 2019).

**Shopee's Disruption of Global Physical Retail**

Understanding Shopee as a disruptive technology involves a fundamental examination at (1) what makes an innovation disruptive, and (2) the general disruptive attributes of e-commerce.

E-commerce can be best envisioned as a disruptive technology when contextualized through its rudiments, and how it fits the criteria. Disruption entails the process of a newer, smaller innovation, referred to as the “entrants,” as they compete with leading, established companies, known as the “incumbents” (Christensen, 2014). The entrants are able to do so by virtue of concentration on an overlooked unprofitable audience by incumbents (low-end) or through offering convenience and lower costs, consequently enabling a new demographic of consumers (new-market) (Christensen et al., 2015). Furthermore, these are described to transform consumers by steering them away from the mainstream option, into the new one, due to these incentives (Christensen, 2014).

The meteoric rise of e-commerce closely follows this paradigm. Boasting benefits such as convenience, lower costs, and a wider variety of products, it has attracted traditional, physical store customers. On the other hand, cheaper capital and potential for a wider customer base has attracted businesses alike. Its transformative effect is manifested in changing consumer behaviors.

With this, situating Shopee within the context where it has thrived can give insight to its disruptive effects. Southeast Asia, Shopee’s main geographic scope where it has been observed to have established itself, has a distinguished demographic that is palpably ripe for disruption. This is due to a growing Internet penetration rate, developing middle socioeconomic class, and increasingly accessible information and communication technologies (Affifa, 2024). The COVID-19 pandemic has also worked in Shopee’s favor, facilitating this disruption due to a lack of other options, introducing the technology to an even bigger demographic. Affifa (2024) reported a pattern of consumers in Southeast Asia that prefer e-commerce due to a variety of reasons including convenience, wider array of products, lower costs, and functionalities that allow people to see reviews from fellow buyers.

**Country-Specific Retail Environments**

Shopee’s effect can also be contextualized within the countries whose physical retail industry has been disrupted.

**Indonesia.**
The Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Indonesia (2023) have emphasized the transformative aspect of e-commerce, primarily Shopee, in the country’s retail industry, noting an increasing preference to it over physical stores, projecting by 2027 a number of 21.8% of sales from e-commerce. This development is also once again attributed to the increasing digital accessibility through Internet penetration in the country’s population. Nurhayati-Wolff (2024) predicts 134 million e-commerce users by 2029, with revenues to cross $100B by 2027. Furthermore, the disruption ushered by e-commerce was dated as early as the mid-2000s, presenting challenges to traditional businesses (Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Indonesia, 2023).

**Malaysia.**
Shopee has also established itself as a dominant retail force in Malaysia. Though not to the same extent that Indonesia harbored, Shopee has still made waves in transforming the retail industry of Malaysia, boasting a 48% increase in the e-commerce market value (Siddharta, 2024). Regarding consumer preferences, 73% of Malaysians responded positively towards buying on e-commerce platforms after the pandemic, having grown more than two-fold, putting into perspective its role in facilitating the disruption (Standard Chartered, 2020, as cited in Jaafar, 2020).

Other countries under the scope of Shopee’s expansion have also experienced its disruptive potential. In Vietnam, platforms like Shopee lead the quickly burgeoning e-commerce market (Nguyen, 2024).

Considering the disrupted, the ways that Shopee had changed the retail industry did not necessarily spell out the absolute end of physical retail stores globally. Right now, consumers are described to still shop both online and offline depending on their circumstances and products needed (Breugelmans et al., 2023). However, the disruption brought about by e-commerce, particularly Shopee, is by virtue of forcing physical retailers to adjust in ways not originally anticipated due to the disruptors, fundamentally changing the environment of retail and consequently consumers’ expectations. As such, physical retailers are left with no choice but to adjust to the shifting landscape of the industry to stay afloat, by potentially incentivizing traditional shopping (Breugelmans et al., 2023), just as e-commerce provided benefits to attract customers.

### *Local/Domestic Physical Retail Industry*

Physical retail in the Philippines continues to face challenges as e-commerce giant, Shopee, dominates the market. According to Statistica Research Department, in 2024, Shopee accounted for the  51% of the share traffic of e-commerce platform in the Philippines. 

This trend remains as an after effect of the pandemic, which greatly affected consumer behavior. Because of the lockdowns and restrictions, shoppers are forced to switch into online shopping. The convenience and flexibility it brings has transformed consumer shopping habits reducing the foot traffic in many physical stores. According to Philippine Retailers Association (PRA) President, Roberto S. Claudio Sr., e-commerce only accounted for 3-5% of total retail sales during the pre-pandemic era. However, these numbers gain a significant increase in 2023 by going up to 20-25%. 

In the same statement, Claudio raised his concerns with the uneven playing field between e-commerce and the brick-and-mortar businesses. Because while physical stores are required to pay 12% value-added tax, e-commerce retailers are only subjected to pay 1% withholding tax (Legaspi, 2023). This creates a clear tax imbalance between traditional physical stores and online retailers. 

The threat that e-commerce poses to brick-and-mortar business is also evident in malls. Despite the “mall culture” in the Philippines, mall vacancies are still increasing. According to Colliers director and head of research, Joey Roic Bondoc, vacancy has increased from 9-10%, in the pre-pandemic era, to 15% this year. Among the reasons for this rise is the closure of many stores during the pandemic. Furthermore, Colliers reported that vacancy rate in Metro Manila will increase from 15.5% to 17% by the end of the year. 

The rapid growth of e-commerce, especially in platforms such as Shopee, has truly shifted the retail landscape. With the pandemic accelerating this shift, consumers were forced to adapt to such change. However, this trend did not only impact the shopping habits of consumers but the performance of physical retails as well. As highlighted by industry experts, the rise of e-commerce is both an opportunity and a risk — opportunity to expand, but a risk in closure of traditional retail.
